# Goal Progression for my pal (JavaScript)

0. JS forgives. It doesn't expect much.

1. Basic syntax
2. Basic statements, expressions, operators
3. Loops/conditionals
4. Functions (piecemeal everything into digestible chunks)
5. Working with collections (arrays, objects)
6. Writing classes to create object instances (do cool stuff)
7. First small projects; one page site
8. Small site, few pages (auto-gen), connected to DB
9. An app that does something cool
10. Replicate existing site/service/app
11. Build something large for yourself; explore
